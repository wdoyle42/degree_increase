Thinking about a descriptive approach to underestanding total degree increase 
in the US, 2000-2019.

1. How many more degrees?
2. Where were the degrees awarded?
3. Are we on track for any of the goals? Where is it closr or farther away?
4. Can we say whether degree increases tracked with any of the 
proposed policy changes?
5. Can we say whether they tracked with anything else?

What's a degree? 

Let's say it's an AA or a BA. Figure out why this is ok.
